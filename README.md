## LaTeX_tidbits
# A collection of some packages and commands for maths-related LaTeX endeavours
Basic layout for __homework assignments__ in maths courses that I have found helpful, mixed with some shortcuts and redefinitions for workflow purposes. <br>
Will occasionally be updated when I discover something particularly useful, but intentionally does not contain code that is very context specific.
Some commands have been adapted from a stylesheet handed out in a linear Algebra course at TU Berlin in the summer of 2023 that is currently not found anywhere online. Fair use applies.
> Note that some details, like Eulers number being upright, or quotation marks, might be specific to german typesetting and/or my own liking.
